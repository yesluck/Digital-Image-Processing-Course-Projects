These are Digital Image Processing Projects Using MATLAB

路 Stitched multiple photos together using affine transformation and perspective transformation路 Designed an algorithm to wipe off the background and reflect lights from workpiece photos using homomorphic filtering路 Wiped off smog in the picture using 6 different ways such as homomorphic filtering and Guided Image Filtering, analyzed and compared the performances under different scenarios
路 Reproduced HDR

May add some notes and comments in the future.
